## About

This is a swift implementation of the cue-pin-select algorithm from [the cue-pin-select paper](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01781231/file/Cue_Pin_Select__a_Secure_and_Usable_Offline_Password_Scheme%20%286%29.pdf).

The goal of the algorithm is for it to be easily human computable while still being unbreakable from a security standpoint. By being human computable, it allows people to store their passwords in memory rather than relying on digital password managers which can be a single point of failure.

## How to start

To explore the project, simply create a new Xcode project from this git repository.
